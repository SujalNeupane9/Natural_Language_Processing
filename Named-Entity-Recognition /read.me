#Named-Entity-Recognition

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves identifying and classifying named entities in a text into predefined categories such as names of persons, organizations, locations, dates, numerical expressions, and more. The main goal of NER is to extract relevant information and understand the structure of the text by recognizing these entities.

## Purpose of Named Entity Recognition:
NER is a fundamental NLP task with various applications, such as:

**Information retrieval**: Extracting valuable information from unstructured texts.
**Information extraction**: Identifying relationships between entities.
**Document categorization**: Classifying texts based on entity types.
**Question answering**: Understanding and answering questions based on entities mentioned in the question.

##How Does NER Work?
The NER process typically involves the following steps:

**Tokenization**: The input text is split into individual words or tokens.
**Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging**: Assigning grammatical parts of speech to each token (e.g., noun, verb, etc.).
**NER Tagging**: Assigning a label to each token to identify if it represents a named entity and its type (e.g., PERSON, ORGANIZATION, etc.).

##NER Techniques:
There are several approaches to NER, including:

**Rule-based Systems**: Handcrafted rules based on patterns and dictionaries.
**Machine Learning-based Systems**: Utilizing supervised learning algorithms like Conditional Random Fields (CRF) and deep learning models like Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) with Conditional Random Fields (CRF) for sequence labeling tasks.
